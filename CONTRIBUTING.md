# Contributing

You are probably interested in contributing to my project; awesome! But, before you do, I would appreciate if you open an issue explaining the changes that you want to make and then contributing by submitting a pull request.

## Writing commit messages
There are also some "rules" for writing a commit based on [**Chris Beams**](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) "Seven Rules of a Great Git Commit Message". Adhering to these rules makes both our lives easier.

* Separate subject from body with a blank line.
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
* Capitalize the subject line.
* Do not end the subject line with a period.
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
* Wrap the body at 72 characters.
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

**Example Title:**
```
Add styling navigation bar
```

Looking forward to your contribution!
